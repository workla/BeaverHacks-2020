OSU Course Survivor Website:  Find your class, rate the class required and supplemental material, and have the chance to supply alternate resources that may help other students succeed in the course.



Inspiration
Inspiration came from the Slack community. How many requests do you see every quarter about what to use to prepare for a class or how people studied the material or studied for exams? Every quarter the same questions come up, so this website hopes to offer a solution, an area to bring together those conversations.

What it does
This is meant to be a hub for user resources for classes. It gives a visual representation of the usefulness of the class-supplied resources and then allows you to add your own rating. It also provides an area to suggest alternate resources and upvote or downvote resources others have mentioned to ensure the most popular resources arrive at the top.

How we built it
We used HTML/CSS/JS on the front end and passed a lot via handlebars, with Node.js, express, handlebars, and a lot of mySQL. We utilized heroku for this project.

Challenges we ran into
We became a team of only two rather quickly, so trying to create a usable project in the short time was probably the most challenging. Heroku took a while to get working, as well as learning more of the nuances of handlebars.

Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud we actually came up with something that looks clean and works as intended in the end.

What we learned
You are not going to be able to do everything you wish you could. Focus and start early, and be proud of what you do finish.

What's next for OSU Course Survivor
Lots! It would be nice to have a login system where your votes only get counted once and you could also save resources. Ideally we could add sort functions for the alternate resources, with options to search for specific topics/course weeks would be great.
